In `requestHandlers.js`, when I added `/tmp/test.png` nothing showed in the browser and the server crashed. However, once I changed it to point to the project's root directory by writing `./tmp/test.png` I got my image. Is this an example of one of the things we had to debug, or was I missing something about how this is supposed to work?
